# 👋 Welcome to My ML/AI Learning Repository

Hi there! 🌟 This repository is my personal **learning playground** where I document additional insights about Machine Learning and AI. Think of it as my digital notebook 📓 where I experiment with curious topics, dig deeper into interesting concepts, and try to answer the "why" behind everything.

> 💡 **Why this exists:** I want to learn more and understand the levels of ML/AI whilst answering my curious questions about some things related to them

## 🧠 Models I've Explored So Far

Here are the ML models I've learned about so far.

| 🤖 Model | 📝 Notes | ⌨️ Type |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Linear Regression (OLS)** | Predicts continuous values using ordinary least squares (The basics) | Linear/Parametric |
| **Linear Probability Model** | Simple binary outcomes but has limitations | Linear/Parametric (Binary) |
| **Logistic Regression** |  Better than LPM - uses sigmoid function to keep probabilities between 0-1 | Linear/Parametric (Binary) |
| **Generalized Linear Model (Binomial)** | A specific family of GLM (this is the same as LOGIT) | Linear/Parametric (Binary) |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** | Find the closest to predictor then vote | Instance-Based/Non-Parametric |
| **Decision Trees** | Like a flowchart for decisions | Tree-Based/Non-Parametric |
| **Bagging** | Bootstrap Aggregating - many models > one model | Ensemble (Tree-Based) |
| **Random Forest** | A forest of decision trees | Ensemble (Tree-Based) |
| **AdaBoost** | ... | ... |
| **Gradient Boost** | ... | ... |
| **XGBoost** | ... | ... |
